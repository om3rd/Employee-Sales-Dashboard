## Problem Statement

In this dashboard, there is a table with the employees of a company in a period; the targeted and actual sales ratio for the whole period, the targeted and actual sales ratio for the last three periods, and general information for the entire period. In addition, the 7 users with the highest targeted and realized rate are statically included in the table with their visuals. 

Thanks to these visualizations, inferences can be made about which employees have met the targets for the company and which ones have not, providing information and analysis about the performance of the employees, as well as providing incentives for employees who perform well.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a CSV file.
- Step 2 : Created a new measurements table to save further measurements on this table.
- Step 3 : Measures were created. 23 measures were created in total. 
- Step 4 : In the report view, I have created my own canvas.
- Step 5 : Added visual filter (Slicer) for employee name filtering.
